In file output.pdf is seen output of profiling function that calculating standard deviation with
10, 100 and 1000 input values.

Program takes the most time invoking functions Pow and Sum. Function Pow is invoked as many times
as input values count + 1. Function Sum is invoked as many times as input values count * 2.
When optimizing code, we should focus just on function Pow and Sum.
